        "One reason the scene works so well on repeated viewings is that it's essentially a sketch. The scene is just as funny on 
        its own as it is within the context of the movie, and that's due to its brilliant concept. Everyone who's ever been to 
        the DMV knows how painful an experience it is. It takes forever, and to those forced to wait for hours, it seems as if 
        the employees are being slow on purpose. Therefore, in a world populated by animals, the famously slow sloths would of 
        course be the sole employees of the DMV.

        OK, so the sketch has a good concept, but then what? Well, any sketch worth its salt takes its concept and then heightens
         it with more extreme and specific scenarios. Take the famous "More Cowbell" sketch from Saturday Night Live for example. 
         The sketch takes the concept of Blue Oyster Cult's producer ludicrously demanding more cowbell in their song "Don't Fear 
         the Reaper", and they heighten that concept by having Will Ferrell perform the negligible instrument in more ridiculous 
         ways as the sketch progresses.
         
         t's the same strategy seen in the sloth scene. Flash the sloth repeats everything Judy says to him very slowly, and then
          when the audience thinks he's about to finish his task and relieve the situation, a wrinkle is thrown in where he responds
           to a joke told by Nick. His slowly spreading smile shows a new facet of his slowness, and gets a bigger laugh than what 
           came before it. Then, in his coup de gr√¢ce, he repeats the joke, really hitting home the premise that dealing with this 
        sloth is going to take forever."
